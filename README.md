This application was setup by following this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/).

In using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [express-generator-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript) for generating the client and the API app, respectively, it is important to notice that both applications are using [Typescript].
